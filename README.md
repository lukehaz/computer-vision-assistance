I want to create a computer vision application using a web-cam(or possibly VR headset) deployed on a rasberrypi (for mobility) to assist the visually impaired. I would like this to alert them of certain obsticles, tell them the colors of things they are "looking" at, and tell them the visual emotions of those around them.
